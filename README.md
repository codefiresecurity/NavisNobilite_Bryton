# Bryton Bike Computer Sync

The S800 bike computer that I have doesn't include the ability in it's mobile app (Bryton Active) to upload to RideWithGPS. Using the "Export FIT" option in the app along with a NextCloud server and this script I was able to automate the upload process. Thanks to Jean at RideWithGPS for insight into how their site works even though automated upload isn't offically part of their API.
